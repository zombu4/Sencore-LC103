# LC103 Reverse Engineering Repository

This repository consolidates all recovered LC103 reverse-engineering work into one canonical folder:

- `all_reverse_engineering/`

## Structure
- `all_reverse_engineering/analysis_runs/`
  - `decompile_v1.53/`
  - `software_decompile_2026-02-24/`
  - `2026-02-24_full_decompile_run2/`
- `all_reverse_engineering/source_material/`
  - original firmware and source downloads used during RE
- `all_reverse_engineering/knowledge/`
  - RE knowledge, project memory/state, and LC103 runbook index
- `all_reverse_engineering/modern_app/`
  - reconstructed modern calibration app work
- `all_reverse_engineering/stray_home_extractions/`
  - extracted VI artifacts that were previously emitted in the home directory
- `all_reverse_engineering/manifests/`
  - `file_list.txt`, `sha256.txt`, `files_by_size.txt`

## Notes
