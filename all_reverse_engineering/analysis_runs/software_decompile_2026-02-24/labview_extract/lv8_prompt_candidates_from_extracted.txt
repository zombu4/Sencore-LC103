DAQ SCXITrackHoldErr:  A signal has already been assigned to the SCXI track-and-hold trigger line, or a control call was inappropriate because the specified module is not configured for one-channel operation.
DAQ badChanErr:  A channel is out of range for the board type or input configuration; or the combination of channels is not allowed; or the scan order must be reversed (0 last).
DAQ extConvRestrictionErr:  This board does not allow an external sample clock with an external scan clock, start trigger, or stop trigger.
DAQ firmwareErr:  The firmware does not support the specified operation, or the firmware operation could not complete due to a data-integrity problem.
DAQ gateSignalErr:  Attempted to start a pulse width measurement with the pulse in the phase to be measured (e.g., high phase for high-level gating).
DAQ limitsOutOfRange:  The requested input limits exceed the board's capability or configuration.  Alternative limits were selected.
DAQ multConnectErr:  The specified RTSI signal is already being driven by a RTSI line, or the specified RTSI line is already being driven by a RTSI signal.
DAQ noTrigEnabledErr:  The number of total scans and pretrigger scans implies that a triggered start is intended, but triggering is not enabled.
DAQ or DSP configFileErr:  The driver could not locate or open the configuration file, or the format of the configuration file is not compatible with the currently installed driver.
DAQ osInitErr:  The driver encountered an operating-system error while attempting to perform an operation, or the operating system does not support an operation performed by the driver.
DAQ overFlowErr:  Because of system limitations, the driver could not read data from the device fast enough to keep up with the device throughput; the onboard device memory reported an overflow error.
DAQ reservedPinErr:  The selected signal requires a pin that is reserved and configured only by NI-DAQ.  You cannot configure this pin yourself.
DAQ sc2040InputModeErr: When you have an SC2040 attached to your device, all analog input channels must be configured for differential input mode.
