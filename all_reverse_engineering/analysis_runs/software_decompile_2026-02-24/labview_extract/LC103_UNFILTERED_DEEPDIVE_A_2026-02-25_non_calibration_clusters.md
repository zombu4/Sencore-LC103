# Non-calibration clusters that emerged from the unfiltered corpus

1. **NI-DAQ remote control subsystem (~2,189,065 line hits).** The corpus contains millions of decompiler lines touching `Final_Cal_nidaq_dll`/`nidaq32_nidaq32_dll`; repeated functions such as `UpdateRemoteNIDAQ`, `DisableVXIMoveInNIDAQ`, `SendMessageTimeoutA` on `s_NIDAQRemoteSyncAccessEvent`, and `GetEnvironmentVariableA(..., s_NIDAQRmtBufferMgrAccessMutex_...)` show that the firmware bundle embeds a full remote-access handshake, remote buffer mutex, and VXI/NIDAQ flow. That logic appears alongside the calibration code, so gating the wizard via these remote DAQ paths (environment flags, event handles, mutexes) could silently change how commands are dispatched when the NI-DAQ bridge is present.

2. **Serial driver and serial-number helpers (~7,358 hits for `serial`).** Notes produced from the corpus reference `Open Serial Driver.vi`, the legacy `Set Serial Port Buffer Size.vi`, and repeated `Set Serial Number` command hits that are tracked in `notes/103FIN_command_hits_*`. The command catalogs show the wizard may fire serial-port initialization VIs before dispatching calibration commands, and the `Set Serial Number` string appears in multiple contexts (`HIT@62954 ... Set Serial Number`). Any workflow automation that assumes calibration runs alone may need to account for the serial-service initialization and the risk of serial-number related messages landing interleaved with calibration prompts.

3. **Error/timeout signaling (`Error\\FC Out`, `Error\\FC In`, `Timeout`).** There are roughly 25,916 lines with `Error\\FC Out` and 22,003 with `Error\\FC In` plus 6,870 `Timeout` hits (per substring scan), all of them appearing in the `Final_Cal_103FIN.EXE` string dump and command hit contexts (`HIT@63426`, `HIT@63730`, etc.). These messages map to failure cases that are much more prevalent than a sparse calibration error, so any workflow logic that still assumes calibration never branches into FC (Field Calibration) error recovery may miss critical gating (e.g., RC failover, message shown before `Set Serial Number`).
