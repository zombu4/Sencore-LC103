FDAQ overRunErr:  The clock source for the input task is faster than the maximum clock rate the device supports.  If you are allowing the driver to calculate the analog input channel clock rate, the driver bases the clock rate on the board type; so you should check that your board type is correct in the configuration utility.YDAQ earlyStopErr:  The transfer stopped prior to reaching the end of the transfer buffer.^DAQ transferStoppedErr:  The transfer has been stopped to prevent regeneration of output data.MDAQ dataNotAvailErr:  The requested amount of data has not yet been acquired.FDAQ calibrationErr:  An error occurred during the calibration process.GDAQ timeOutErr: The operation could not complete within the time limit.
