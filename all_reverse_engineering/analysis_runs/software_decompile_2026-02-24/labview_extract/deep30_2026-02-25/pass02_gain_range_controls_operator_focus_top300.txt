The read subVI inside the While Loop searches for the last end-of-line, but does not return any data.  Once that location is found, the read subVI outside the loop reads the entire string.  This method is faster for a large number of lines, because it does not require the use of a string concatentation function in the loop and its associated memory suffling, but this method is slower for a few lines.d:\automated\lv51\lvsource\gencode.cGenRangeCheck
