52510:1bd790 This VI has a bad connection to or cannot find a subVI or external routine, but it has no block diagram to show or fix the error. You must find or correct the subVI or external routine. Check for more information in the Explain... dialog in Get Info.
52516:1bdd78 A wire must be connected to one and only one data source, such as a control's terminal or a function output. This wire is not connected to any source. Find the source of this data and make sure it is a control (not indicator) or an output (not input).
52523:1be44b The connector pane connections of the subVI do not match the way it is wired on this diagram. Show the Help window to see what the connections to this subVI should be.
52524:1be4f3 One or more required inputs to this function are not wired or are wired incorrectly. Show the Help window to see what the connections to this function should be.
52525:1be595 A wire can be connected to only one data source, such as a control's terminal or a function output. This wire is connected to more than one source. Make sure that all connections except one are to indicators (not controls) or inputs (not outputs).
