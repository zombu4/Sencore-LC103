48193:1651e4 This is the revision number that will be included in new history entries.  The current number is displayed in the Instrument Information dialog.  It is incremented every time you save the VI.
48196:165404 If you check this box, you will not be prompted for a comment on the rest of the VIs in this hierarchy that are being closed at this time, even if they have one of the prompt for comment options set.
48198:165560 This is the revision number that will be included in new history entries.  The current number is displayed in the Instrument Information dialog.  It is incremented every time you save the VI.
48271:166b04 This is the default for the VI Setup of new VIs.  If a VI has this option set, LabVIEW will add an entry to the VI's history every time it is saved, even if you do not enter a comment.
