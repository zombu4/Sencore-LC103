This list box contains the errors and warnings for the selected VI.  If an error is associated with an object, you can double-click on the error to highlight the object on the VI's front panel or block diagram.  You can also press return or click on the 'Find' button.
`This box shows you more details about the error or warning currently selected in the Error List.
This ring contains the names of all VIs in memory that have errors or warnings.  The VIs are ordered such that subVIs are listed before their calling VIs.  Therefore, when fixing problems with a hierarchy of VIs, you should fix those VIs that are at the top of this ring first.
When the selected error or warning is associated with an object, clicking on this button will highlight that object on the VI's front panel or block diagram.

error in is a cluster of elements that describes any previous error you want to check. If it is unwired or indicates no error, the VI checks the error codes array instead. See Simple Error Handler for additional information.

This subVI tests the error status output of one or more low-level functions or subVIs that output a numeric error code, and creates an error out cluster that can be wired to the Simple or General Error Handler in order to identify the error and describe it to the user.
You can optionally use the source messages string to pass on the source of the error. Enter one line of text for each element of the error codes array.
The error? status  is TRUE on any error.
If the error in cluster has a status of no-error, then test each element of error codes array, stopping on the first non-zero value or after all are tested; pick the selected line from the optional source messages as the error out source.

user-defined codes is an array of the numeric error codes you define in your VIs. The VI searches this array after searching the internal list of error codes. Codes in the range of 5000 to 9999 are reserved for users.

Select measurement function.
Range selection has no effect in the mA DC and mA AC functions since all measurements in these functions are made in the 20000 mA range.             If the chosen range is not valid for selected function, the nearest valid range is selected.
The status boolean is either TRUE (X) for an error, or FALSE (checkmark) for no error or a warning.
The pop-up option Explain Error (or Explain Warning) gives more information about the error displayed.

Dcode out is the error code indicated by the error in or error code.
yexception source is the error message that you want to use to test for an exception. By default, it is an empty string.
ferror in describes an error that you want to check. If unwired, this VI checks error code for errors.
1code is the error code associated with an error.
xerror out contains the same information as status out, code out, and source out. It has the same structure as error in.
imessage describes the error code that occurred, the source of the error, and a description of the error.

Astatus is TRUE if an error occurred; the default value is FALSE.
0code is the error code; the default value is 0.
vsource is in most cases the name of the VI or function that produced the error; the default value is an empty string.
%status is TRUE if an error occurred.
Psource is in most cases the name of the VI or function that produced the error.
1refnum is the reference number of the open file.

lprompt is the message that appears below the list of files and directories (or folders) in the file dialog.
\default name is the initial file name that appears in the selection box of the file dialog.
rsource identifies where the error occurred and is usually the name of the function or VI that produced the error.
scode is the identification number of the error. Use the General Error Handler.vi to get a description of the error.4#O
file path is the path name of the file. If file path is empty (default value) or is Not A Path, the VI displays a File dialog box from which you can select a file. Error 43 occurs if the user cancels the dialog.   <#
irefnum is the reference number of the open file. The value is Not A Refnum if the file cannot be opened.
