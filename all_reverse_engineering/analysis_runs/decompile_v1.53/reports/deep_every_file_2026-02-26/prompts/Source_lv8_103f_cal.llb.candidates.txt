*error in is a cluster of three elements (status, code, and source) that describe the upstream error state, that is, the existence of any error proceeding the execution of the VI. The VI executes normally only if no incoming error exists; otherwise it merely passes the error in value to error out.

This VI establishes a port configuration. You can use the task ID that this VI returns only in digital port VIs.
This VI reads the port identified by task ID and returns the pattern read.
This integer represents a GPIB address.  The low byte is the primary GPIB address (0-30) and the high byte is either 0 or a secondary GPIB address (96-126 or 0x60-0x7E).  Use MakeAddress.vi to construct a GPIB address which uses secondary addressing.RNcount. The VI returns up to count data bytes from the device in data string.

This input is useful when you use this VI inside a loop and want to close the file only on the last loop iteration or on an upstream error.  In that case, set close when? TRUE on the last iteration, and terminate the loop on the last iteration or when this VI returns an error.

The VI executes normally only if no incoming error exists; otherwise it merely passes the error in value to error out.  error? is TRUE if an error occurred; the default value is FALSE.  code is the error code; the default value is 0.  source is in most cases the name of the VI or function that produced the error; the default value is an empty string.

line mode  Set TRUE to read until a line marker or end of line is encounter or count characters are read.  Set FALSE (default value) to read until count characters are read or end of line is encountered.  A line mark is a carriage return, a line feed, or a carriage return followed by a line feed.
lprompt is the message that appears below the list of files and directories (or folders) in the file dialog.
new file path is the path of the file from which the VI read data.  You can use this output to determine the path of a file that you open using dialog.  new file path returns Not A Path if the user selects Cancel from the dialog box.
