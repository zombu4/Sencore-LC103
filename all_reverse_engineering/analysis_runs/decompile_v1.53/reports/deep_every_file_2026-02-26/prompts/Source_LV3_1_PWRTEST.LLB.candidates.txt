%UNIT_OFF line fails
(i32) line mask: determines which lines this VI reads. If you set line mask to -1 (all ones), the VI reads the entire port. If you set only bit n in line mask, the VI reads only line n of the port. If the state of line n is high, the VI sets bit n of pattern. The VI sets to 0 the bits of pattern that correspond to lines the VI has not read. The default setting for line mask is -1 which is shown as all ones since the binary representation is the default selection.62(u32) pattern: the data the VI read from the port.51(u32) task ID out: has the same value as task ID.

/Primary GPIB address ranging from 0 to 30.  Used to form the low order byte of the GPIB address which will be accepted by 488.2 functions.  The value of 31 (default) means return the NOADDR constant (0xFFFF) as the packed address.  The VI places primary address in the lower byte of the packed address.

Most applications need only connect wires to the controls and indicators displayed in bold.  Connections to other controls and indicators are useful only if specifically needed.
Normal Use:  When using subVIs that incorporate the error in/error out (or error I/O) structure, place this handler where you want to inform the user of an error, typically at the end of the I/O data path, as the last action of the program.  If the error in status is ERROR, the handler creates a message describing the error and its source.  If the type of dialog = 1 (default), the message is displayed to the user, who can only acknowedge it.  If the type = 2, the user can acknowledge the message or abort execution; aborting a program with active I/O is not recommended.  If the type = 0, no message is displayed; this is used to process the error programmatically, and the error out cluster elements are wired to individual terminals for that reason.

exception handling.  This mechanism is available either to set the error out status FALSE on what is normally an error or to set the status TRUE on what is normally not an error.  If exception action > 0, the error in code and source are checked.  If they match the exception code and source, the error out status is adjusted accordingly.  That is, if the action = 1, the error out status is set to FALSE and code is set to zero and if the action = 2, the error out is set to TRUE and the code is unchanged.  An empty exception source matches any error in source.

local testing.  To test the error code of a subVI or function that does not have the error I/O structure, you can wire its error code and a source string to the local error code and error source inputs.  If error in status indicates no error and error code is not equal to 0, the local code and source are substituted for the error in values, and the status is set TRUE (ERROR).

source. In case of an error, most VIs that use the error in and error out clusters set source to the name of the VI or function that produced the error.
status is a Boolean array in which each bit describes a state of the GPIB Controller. If an error occurs, the GPIB VIs set bit 15. GPIB error is valid only if bit 15 of status is set.
x(i32) line mask: determines which lines in the port the write affects. If you set line mask to -1, the VI writes to the entire port and sets all the lines in the port to the states specified by the bits in pattern. If you set only bit n in line mask, the VI changes only line n in the port to the state that bit n of pattern specifies. The default setting for line mask is -1.51(u32) task ID out: has the same value as task ID.
