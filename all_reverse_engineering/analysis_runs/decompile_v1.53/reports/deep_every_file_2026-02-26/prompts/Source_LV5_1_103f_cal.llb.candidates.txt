(i32) line mask: determines which lines this VI reads. If you set line mask to -1 (all ones), the VI reads the entire port. If you set only bit n in line mask, the VI reads only line n of the port. If the state of line n is high, the VI sets bit n of pattern. The VI sets to 0 the bits of pattern that correspond to lines the VI has not read. The default setting for line mask is -1 which is shown as all ones since the binary representation is the default selection.62(u32) pattern: the data the VI read from the port.51(u32) task ID out: has the same value as task ID.

If the error in cluster has a status of no-error, then test each element of error codes array, stopping on the first non-zero value or after all are tested; pick the selected line from the optional source messages as the error out source.
If you want to test for an error from three local functions (for example, Open File, Read File, and Close File), wire their error outputs to a Build Array function, as elements 0-2 respectively.  If an error occurs at Read File, the VI picks the second line for the source message of the error out cluster. Use of this input is optional.

Normal Use:  When using subVIs that incorporate the error in/error out (or error I/O) structure, place this handler where you want to inform the user of an error, typically at the end of the I/O data path, as the last action of the program.  If the error in status is ERROR, the handler creates a message describing the error and its source.  If the type of dialog = 1 (default), the message is displayed to the user, who can only acknowedge it.  If the type = 2, the user can acknowledge the message or abort execution; aborting a program with active I/O is not recommended.  If the type = 0, no message is displayed; this is used to process the error programmatically, and the error out cluster elements are wired to individual terminals for that reason. 
Now connect the red UUT to the H  Terminal of the decade box and set the  box to 0.022uF(.0219).

The read subVI inside the While Loop searches for the last end-of-line, but does not return any data.  Once that location is found, the read subVI outside the loop reads the entire string.  This method is faster for a large number of lines, because it does not require the use of a string concatentation function in the loop and its associated memory suffling, but this method is slower for a few lines.\

When you use the serial port VIs on a Sun SPARCstation, the port number parameter is 0 for /dev/ttya, 1 for /dev/ttyb, and so on.
Wrequested byte count specifies the number of characters to be read. If you want to read all of the characters currently at the serial port, first execute the Bytes at Serial Port VI to determine the exact number of bytes ready to be read. Then use the byte count output of that VI as the requested byte count input to the Serial Port Read VI.
Writes a character string to a new byte stream file or appends the string to an existing file.  The VI opens or creates the file beforehand and closes it afterwards.
XON/XOFF is a software handshaking protocol you can use to avoid overflowing serial port buffers. When the receive buffer is nearly full, the receiver sends XOFF (<controlS> [decimal 19]) to tell the other device to stop sending data. When the receive buffer is sufficiently empty, the receiver sends XON (<controlQ> [decimal 17]) to indicate that transmission can begin again. When you enable XON/XOFF, the devices always interpret <controlQ> and <controlS> as XON and XOFF characters, never as data. When you disable XON/XOFF, you can send <controlQ> and <controlS> as data. Do not use XON/XOFF with binary data transfers because <controlQ> or <controlS> may be embedded in the data, and the devices will interpret them as XON and XOFF instead of data.

error in is a cluster of three elements (error?, code, and source) that describe the upstream error state, that is, the existance of any error preceeding the execution of the VI.  The VI executes normally only if no incoming error exists; otherwise it merely passes the error in value to error out.  error? is TRUE if an error occurred; the default value is FALSE.  code is the error code; the default value is 0.  source is in most cases the name of the VI or function that produced the error; the default value is an empty string.
exception handling.  This mechanism is available either to set the error out status FALSE on what is normally an error or to set the status TRUE on what is normally not an error.  If exception action > 0, the error in code and source are checked.  If they match the exception code and source, the error out status is adjusted accordingly.  That is, if the action = 1, the error out status is set to FALSE and code is set to zero and if the action = 2, the error out is set to TRUE and the code is unchanged.  An empty exception source matches any error in source.

local testing.  To test the error code of a subVI or function that does not have the error I/O structure, you can wire its error code and a source string to the local error code and error source inputs.  If error in status indicates no error and error code is not equal to 0, the local code and source are substituted for the error in values, and the status is set TRUE (ERROR).

|error in is a cluster that describes the error status before this VI executes. If error in indicates that an error occurred before this VI was called, this VI may choose not to execute its function, but just pass the error through to its error out cluster. If no error has occurred, then this VI executes normally and sets its own error status in error out. Use the error handler VIs to look up the error code and to display the corresponding error message. Using error in and error out clusters is a convenient way to check errors and to specify execution order by wiring the error output from one subVI to the error input of the next.
