(i32) line mask: determines which lines this VI reads. If you set line mask to -1 (all ones), the VI reads the entire port. If you set only bit n in line mask, the VI reads only line n of the port. If the state of line n is high, the VI sets bit n of pattern. The VI sets to 0 the bits of pattern that correspond to lines the VI has not read. The default setting for line mask is -1 which is shown as all ones since the binary representation is the default selection.62(u32) pattern: the data the VI read from the port.51(u32) task ID out: has the same value as task ID.

Normal Use:  When using subVIs that incorporate the error in/error out (or error I/O) structure, place this handler where you want to inform the user of an error, typically at the end of the I/O data path, as the last action of the program.  If the error in status is ERROR, the handler creates a message describing the error and its source.  If the type of dialog = 1 (default), the message is displayed to the user, who can only acknowedge it.  If the type = 2, the user can acknowledge the message or abort execution; aborting a program with active I/O is not recommended.  If the type = 0, no message is displayed; this is used to process the error programmatically, and the error out cluster elements are wired to individual terminals for that reason.

This VI establishes a port configuration. You can use the task ID that this VI returns only in digital port VIs.
This VI reads the port identified by task ID and returns the pattern read.
This integer represents a GPIB address.  The low byte is the primary GPIB address (0-30) and the high byte is either 0 or a secondary GPIB address (96-126 or 0x60-0x7E).  Use MakeAddress.vi to construct a GPIB address which uses secondary addressing.RNcount. The VI returns up to count data bytes from the device in data string.

Wrequested byte count specifies the number of characters to be read. If you want to read all of the characters currently at the serial port, first execute the Bytes at Serial Port VI to determine the exact number of bytes ready to be read. Then use the byte count output of that VI as the requested byte count input to the Serial Port Read VI.

exception handling.  This mechanism is available either to set the error out status FALSE on what is normally an error or to set the status TRUE on what is normally not an error.  If exception action > 0, the error in code and source are checked.  If they match the exception code and source, the error out status is adjusted accordingly.  That is, if the action = 1, the error out status is set to FALSE and code is set to zero and if the action = 2, the error out is set to TRUE and the code is unchanged.  An empty exception source matches any error in source.

status is a Boolean array in which each bit describes a state of the GPIB Controller. If an error occurs, the GPIB VIs set bit 15. GPIB error is valid only if bit 15 of status is set.

uqReads the number of characters specified by requested byte count from the serial port indicated in port number.
x(i32) line mask: determines which lines in the port the write affects. If you set line mask to -1, the VI writes to the entire port and sets all the lines in the port to the states specified by the bits in pattern. If you set only bit n in line mask, the VI changes only line n in the port to the state that bit n of pattern specifies. The default setting for line mask is -1.51(u32) task ID out: has the same value as task ID.
|error in is a cluster that describes the error status before this VI executes. If error in indicates that an error occurred before this VI was called, this VI may choose not to execute its function, but just pass the error through to its error out cluster. If no error has occurred, then this VI executes normally and sets its own error status in error out. Use the error handler VIs to look up the error code and to display the corresponding error message. Using error in and error out clusters is a convenient way to check errors and to specify execution order by wiring the error output from one subVI to the error input of the next.,%
