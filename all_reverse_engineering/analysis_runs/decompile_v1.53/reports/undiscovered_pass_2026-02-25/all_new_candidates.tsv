Source_LV5_1_103f_cal.llb.txt	182394	Normal Use: When using subVIs that incorporate the error in/error out (or error I/O) structure, place this handler where you want to inform the user of an error, typically at the end of the I/O data path, as the last action of the program. If the error in status is ERROR, the handler creates a message describing the error and its source. If the type of dialog = 1 (default), the message is displayed to the user, who can only acknowedge it. If the type = 2, the user can acknowledge the message or abort execution; aborting a program with active I/O is not recommended. If the type = 0, no message is displayed; this is used to process the error programmatically, and the error out cluster elements are wired to individual terminals for that reason.
Source_LV5_1_103f_cal.llb.txt	185899	exception handling. This mechanism is available either to set the error out status FALSE on what is normally an error or to set the status TRUE on what is normally not an error. If exception action > 0, the error in code and source are checked. If they match the exception code and source, the error out status is adjusted accordingly. That is, if the action = 1, the error out status is set to FALSE and code is set to zero and if the action = 2, the error out is set to TRUE and the code is unchanged. An empty exception source matches any error in source. H

Source_LV5_1_Pwrtest.llb.txt	106551	1This error handler is used primarily to inform the user if an input error exists, to describe the error, and to identify where it occurred. The information for this is derived from the inputs error in, error code, and error source, and from an internal error description table. The table describes all errors that can be created by LabVIEW or its associated I/O operations. The handler has provisions to take alternative actions, such as to cancel or set an error status, and to test for and describe user-defined errors. See instruction on the front panel.

If an incoming error does not exist, the VI executes normally and error out describes the VI's error state; if an incoming error exists, error out equals error in.
Source_LV6_103f_cal.llb.txt	356363	XON/XOFF is a software handshaking protocol you can use to avoid overflowing serial port buffers. When the receive buffer is nearly full, the receiver sends XOFF (<controlS> [decimal 19]) to tell the other device to stop sending data. When the receive buffer is sufficiently empty, the receiver sends XON (<controlQ> [decimal 17]) to indicate that transmission can begin again. When you enable XON/XOFF, the devices always interpret <controlQ> and <controlS> as XON and XOFF characters, never as data. When you disable XON/XOFF, you can send <controlQ> and <controlS> as data. Do not use XON/XOFF with binary data transfers because <controlQ> or <controlS> may be embedded in the data, and the devices will interpret them as XON and XOFF instead of data.

If you set line mask to -1, the VI writes to the entire port and sets all the lines in the port to the states specified by the bits in pattern. If you set only bit n in line mask, the VI changes only line n in the port to the state that bit n of pattern specifies. The default setting for line mask is -1.,
