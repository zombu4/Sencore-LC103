2	General Error Handler.vi	JDAQ badScanListErr: The scan list is invalid; for example, you are mixing AMUX-64T channels and onboard channels or are scanning SCXI channels out of order. Also, the driver attempts to achieve complicated gain distributions over SCXI channels on the same module by manipulating the scan list, and returns this error if it fails.

2	Open File+.vi	File Already Open
2	Open File+.vi	GOpens an existing file programmatically or interactively using dialog. You can optionally specify a dialog prompt, default file name, start path, or filter pattern. Error 7 occurs if the file does not exist. Use this VI with the intermediate level Read File+ VIs described below.
2	Open File+.vi	cFile Dialog cancelled; set Error to Cancelled By User; empty File Path; set Refnum to Not a Refnum.
2	Open File+.vi	new file path is the path of the file opened. You can use this output to determine the path of a file that you open using dialog. new file path returns Not A Path if the user selects Cancel from the dialog box.
2	Open-Create-Replace File.vi	&Opens an existing file, creates a new file, or replaces an existing file, programmatically or interactively using dialog. You can optionally specify a dialog prompt, default file name, start path, or filter pattern, and you can specify open and deny modes when opening a file, plus group and permission when creating a new file. Use this VI with the intermediate Write File+ or Read File+ VIs described below.
