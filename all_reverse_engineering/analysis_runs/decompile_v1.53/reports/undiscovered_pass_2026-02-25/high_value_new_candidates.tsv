2	Source_LV6_103f_cal.llb.txt	356363	XON/XOFF is a software handshaking protocol you can use to avoid overflowing serial port buffers. When the receive buffer is nearly full, the receiver sends XOFF (<controlS> [decimal 19]) to tell the other device to stop sending data. When the receive buffer is sufficiently empty, the receiver sends XON (<controlQ> [decimal 17]) to indicate that transmission can begin again. When you enable XON/XOFF, the devices always interpret <controlQ> and <controlS> as XON and XOFF characters, never as data. When you disable XON/XOFF, you can send <controlQ> and <controlS> as data. Do not use XON/XOFF with binary data transfers because <controlQ> or <controlS> may be embedded in the data, and the devices will interpret them as XON and XOFF instead of data.
