0x23d89f	2349215	exception handling.  This mechanism is available either to set the error out status FALSE on what is normally an error or to set the status TRUE on what is normally not an error.  If exception action > 0, the error in code and source are checked.  If they match the exception code and source, the error out status is adjusted accordingly.  That is, if the action = 1, the error out status is set to FALSE and code is set to zero and if the action = 2, the error out is set to TRUE and the code is unchanged.  An empty exception source matches any error in source.  H
