LC103 CALIBRATION WIZARD RUNDOWN

1. All (Not Ringer) / Start Button
Legacy UI flow: select stage set (typically All (Not Ringer)), then press Start Button. Use Continue Button to advance each prompt. Gate text recovered from old flow: 'Press ENTER when ready, choose test to perform and press START.'

2. Harness/Test Box Setup
Prepare legacy final-cal bench harness before calibration:
1) Connect PA251 power adapter to rear of LC103.
2) Connect RS-232 cable from host PC to LC103 RS-232 port.
3) Connect 39G219 test-lead cable from LC103 front panel to final test box.
4) Connect IEEE cable to RS232 interface port on back-left side of UUT.
5) Power on UUT and verify software revision display.
Legacy fixture variant also appears in source:
- Mainboard tester (#74C216-1) with Fluke 8840A and 50-pin ribbon cable.

3. Pass/Fail Indicator Visibility
Set Pass/ Fail Indicator and make it visible before running tests. Recovered flow also toggles Pass/Fail button invisible in some transitions; ensure visible for operator run.

4. Calibration Data File Selection
Use F1/path controls first if prompted, then select calibration data files:
- Capacitance: P071_03.CAL
- Inductance: P072_1.CAL or approved matching variant.
If file/path prompts loop, re-open path selector with F1 and re-select both .CAL files before continuing.

5. Software Rev. Check
Confirm software revision matches unit display. If software rev file cannot be read, set revision manually on front panel and continue. If revision is invalid or file/path lookup fails, use F1 to fix paths, re-select .CAL files, and retry probe. Recovered warning path: place floppy disk in computer and fix invalid rev after calibration fails.
Commands: VER#?, SER#?
