LC103 CALIBRATION PROCEDURE 
(This unit is mainly calibrated using an automated test.) 
 
1. Connect the PA251 power adapter to the back of the UUT. 
2. Connect the RS232 cable from the back of the computer to the RS232 port on back of 
the UUT. 
3. Connect the 39G219-test lead cable from the front of the UUT to the final test box. 
Hook up the IEEE cable to the RS232 Interface Port located on the back left side of 
the UUT. 
4. Power UUT on. Watch for the software rev. number. (It will read 1.47 or 1.50). 
Double click on “Sencore Tests”. Insert the cal disk. 
5. Boot up the LC103 Final Cal Test program on the computer by double clicking on the 
“LC103 F_Cal “ icon. 
6. Use the “F1” key to apply the correct file information for the inductance and 
capacitance calibrations.  Click on “P071_03.Cal” to set the capacitance cal data. 
Click on “OK”. Click on “P072_10.Cal” to set the inductance cal data. Click on 
“OK”. 
7. Make sure the “Software Rev.” matches what the unit displays (may have to power 
off/on again to recheck). 
8. Highlight “ALL (NOT RINGERS)” by using the left side click button on the mouse. 
9. Highlight “PRESS TO START” by using the left side click button on the mouse. 
10. Follow the prompt on the computer for calibration instructions, making sure to use 
either the “ENTER” or left side click of the mouse for advancing through the 
program. 
11. When the program is done, disconnect the RS232 port cable from the back of the unit 
and power the unit off/on again. 
12. Remove the 39G219 test lead from the final test box to the ringer test box and 
connect to the ringer cal box.  
13. Set the switch for “YOLKS AND FLYBACKS”. 
14. Press the “YOLKS AND FLYBACKS button on the UUT. Press and hold the 
“Inductor Ringer Button”. Watch for the same number that is noted on the ringer test 
box. If not the same, adjust R1144 for the same number. 
15. Set the ringer test box to the “SWITCHING TRANSFORMERS” position. 
16. Press the “SWITCHING TRANSFORMERS” button on the UUT. Press and hold the 
“Inductor Ringer Button”. Watch for the same number. If not the same, adjust R1005 
for the same number. Disconnect the test lead from the ringer box and reconnect to 
the final test box. 
17. Power UUT off. 
18. Disconnect the PA251 power adapter from the back of the UUT. 
19. Disconnect the 39G219-test lead from the front of the UUT. 
20. Carry the unit over to the z-meter bench in Service. Open up the back of the unit. 
Check the battery supply by hooking up to the DC Regulated Power Supply using the 
lead hanging on the bench under the supply. Make sure the power supply is set to 
approximately 12.65V. (Use the voltage coarse knob on the power supply to set.) 
Check and make sure that the unit reads 90% - 100%.  

21. Turn the voltage fine tune knob all the way CCW (counter clock wise) to 
approximately 11V. Make sure unit reads 0% - 10%. Disconnect the DC power 
supply and close the back of the unit and connect the power adapter. Turn unit on by 
pressing POWER. 
22. Connect the test leads to the unit and short them together. Apply 25Volts leakage by 
pressing “2,5,V”. Push and hold the CAPACITOR LEAKAGE button. The right 
display on the unit should show “>20mA” flashing. 
23. Press the “CLEAR” button 3 times. Short the leads to the Large Inductance box. Press 
“SHORT”. Press inductance and make sure unit reads 0.00. Check the inductance 
readings. 
24. Connect the test leads to the high cap box and “open “ them. Check the high cap box 
readings. Specs are in the Standards book on the bench. 
25. Case the UUT and send to age.
